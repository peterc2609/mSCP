Sure, here's a detailed breakdown of macOS features and services that may utilize any of the disallowed algorithms, modes, or protocols you mentioned.
Symmetric Algorithms
•	3DES-EDE-168, 3DES-EDE-112:
•	Disk Images: While newer versions of macOS prefer AES for disk encryption, some older disk images may still use 3DES. Ensure that disk images are re-created with AES encryption if they are using 3DES.
Symmetric Encryption Modes
•	CTR, CBC, XTS, ECB:
•	FileVault: Uses XTS mode of AES. This is considered one of the most secure modes for disk encryption but is disallowed according to your list.
•	Keychain Services: Uses CBC mode of AES. This is common for encrypted data storage but is disallowed according to your list.
•	Wi-Fi: WPA2 uses CBC mode with AES for CCMP, and WPA3 also uses AES in modes that may include CBC.
•	Disk Images: Often use CBC mode for AES encryption. Check configurations and update to approved modes if necessary.
Symmetric Authentication (MAC)
•	CBC-MAC:
•	Wi-Fi: WPA2 may use CBC-MAC in certain configurations, though more often it uses HMAC.
Asymmetric Encryption
•	ECDH with NIST P-521, NIST P-384, NIST P-256:
•	TLS/SSL: Safari, Mail, and other apps may use these curves for key exchange in TLS connections. These curves are commonly used in public key infrastructure but are disallowed according to your list.
Asymmetric Authentication (Signature)
•	ECDSA with NIST P-521, NIST P-384, NIST P-256:
•	TLS/SSL: These curves may be used in digital certificates for signing. Safari, Mail, and other apps may accept certificates signed with these algorithms.
TLS/SSL Protocol Versions
•	TLS 1.1, TLS 1.0, SSL 3.x:
•	General System Use: Older versions of macOS may support these protocols for backward compatibility. Ensure that all systems are updated to use only TLS 1.2 or higher.
TLS 1.3 Cipher Suites
•	TLS_AES_128_CCM_8_SHA256:
•	General TLS Connections: This is a less common cipher suite for TLS 1.3 and may be used in specific scenarios where lightweight encryption is needed.
TLS 1.3 Signature Algorithms
•	ecdsa_secp256r1_sha256, ecdsa_secp384r1_sha384, ecdsa_secp521r1_sha521:
•	TLS Connections: These signature algorithms are often used in TLS connections for certificate validation. They may be used by default in Safari and other macOS applications.
Server and Client SSH Authentication Keys
•	DSA:
•	SSH (Terminal): Older SSH keys might be using DSA. Modern recommendations suggest using Ed25519 or RSA keys instead.
Password Hash Functions
•	PBKDF2:
•	Keychain Services and User Accounts: PBKDF2 is commonly used for hashing passwords. It’s considered secure but might not meet the latest recommendations compared to bcrypt or Argon2.
SSH Protocol Versions
•	PBKDF2:
•	SSH (Terminal): This might be a typo in your list as PBKDF2 is a key derivation function, not an SSH protocol. Ensure clarification if this was intended to refer to password hashing within SSH configurations.
SSH Cipher Suites
•	AESx-CBC with HMAC-SHA2-y x=256,192,128 and y=512,256, 3DES-CBC with HMAC-SHA2-y y=512,256:
•	SSH (Terminal): Older configurations might still support these cipher suites. Ensure SSH configurations are updated to use more secure options like aes256-gcm or chacha20-poly1305.
SSH Key Exchange Methods
•	ECDH-SHA2-NISTPX x=256,384,521:
•	SSH (Terminal): These key exchange methods are widely used in SSH but are disallowed according to your list. Ensure configurations use approved methods like curve25519-sha256.
IKE/IPSec Protocol Versions
•	IKEv1:
•	VPN: Older VPN configurations might still use IKEv1. Ensure all VPN configurations are updated to IKEv2, which is more secure and widely recommended.
Summary of Affected Services
1	FileVault: Uses XTS mode, which is disallowed.
2	Keychain Services: Uses CBC mode for AES, and PBKDF2 for password hashing.
3	Wi-Fi: Uses CBC-MAC and CBC mode for encryption in WPA2.
4	Disk Images: May use CBC mode for AES encryption.
5	Safari, Mail (TLS/SSL): Uses ECDH and ECDSA with NIST curves, may use disallowed TLS protocol versions and cipher suites.
6	SSH (Terminal): Might use DSA keys, CBC cipher suites, and ECDH key exchange methods.
7	VPN: Might use IKEv1.
Recommendations:
•	FileVault: Consider alternative encryption solutions if XTS mode is strictly disallowed.
•	Keychain Services: Review and update encryption and hashing methods if CBC mode and PBKDF2 are not acceptable.
•	Wi-Fi: Ensure WPA3 is configured correctly, avoiding disallowed modes and MACs.
•	Disk Images: Recreate any existing images with allowed encryption modes.
•	TLS/SSL: Update system and application configurations to avoid disallowed algorithms and protocols.
•	SSH: Update SSH configurations to use more secure key types, cipher suites, and key exchange methods.
•	VPN: Ensure all VPN configurations are using IKEv2.
